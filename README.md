# _Einführung in die Algebra_ Review, WS 17/18 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cionx/einfuehrung-in-die-algebra-review-ws-17-18.svg?branch=master)][-1]

These are materials for a review course for the lecture _Einführung in die Algebra_, which was held at the University of Bonn during the winter semester 2017/18.
This review course was held at the end of the semester as a preparation for the upcoming second exam, and was provided by the [Fachschaft Mathematik][FM]. The course took place over five days, for a total of 20 hours.
Compiled versions of the notes and exercise sheets are available below:

-  [notes][0]
-  [sheet 1][1]
-  [sheet 2][2]
-  [sheet 3][3]
-  [sheet 4][4]
-  [sheet 5][5]

Solutions to the exercises were developed during the review sessions by the participants, and are therefore mostly absent from the materials themselves.
All materials are in German
